# Stable Sort
#
# -------------------------------------
# Question
#
# Let's arrange a deck of cards.
# There are totally 36 cards of 4 suits(S, H, C, D) and 9 values (1, 2, ... 9).
# For example, 'eight of heart' is represented by H8 and 'one of diamonds' is represented by D1.
#
# Your task is to write a program which sorts a given set of cards in ascending order by their values using the Bubble Sort algorithms and the Selection Sort algorithm respectively.
#
# -------------------------------------
# Input
#
# The first line contains an integer N, the number of cards.
# N cards are given in the following line.
# Each card is represented by two characters.
# Two consecutive cards are separated by a space character.
#
# -------------------------------------
# Output
#
# In the first line, print the arranged cards provided by the Bubble Sort algorithm.
# Two consecutive cards should be separated by a space character.
#
# In the second line, print the stability ("Stable" or "Not stable") of this output.
#
# In the third line, print the arranged cards provided by the Selection Sort algorithm.
# Two consecutive cards should be separated by a space character.
#
# In the fourth line, print the stability ("Stable" or "Not stable") of this output.
