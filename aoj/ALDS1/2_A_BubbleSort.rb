# Bubble Sort
#
# -------------------------------------
# Question
#
# Write a program of the Bubble Sort algorithm which sorts a sequence A in ascending order.
# Your program should also print the number of swap operations defined in line 4 of the pseudocode.
#
# -------------------------------------
# Input
#
# The first line of the input includes an integer N, the number of elements in the sequence.
# In the second line, N elements of the sequence are given separated by spaces characters.
#
# -------------------------------------
# Output
#
# The output consists of 2 lines.
#
# In the first line, please print the sorted sequence.
# Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character.
#
# In the second line, please print the number of swap operations.
#
# -------------------------------------
# Constraints
#
# 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 100
#
# -------------------------------------
